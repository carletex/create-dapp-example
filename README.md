# üèóÔ∏è create-dapp-example

Testing the best way to have a create-app cli tool.

```bash
yarn create dapp-example
# or
npx create-dapp-example
```

You can also pass [flags](https://github.com/technophile-04/create-dapp-se2/blob/ab4713dd1a5eca90f2b7841ce4c2aa78a69443f2/src/utils/parse-arguments-into-options.ts#L10) to skip prompts.

```bash
yarn create dapp-example my-example-dapp --template se-2-hardhat

# or

yarn create dapp-example my-example-dapp --yes
```

# Understanding the structure :

`src/cli.ts` is the entry point for the cli.

`src/main.ts` defines the task using [listr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/listr) and executes them.

`src/tasks` holds each task logic for example one of the task in `src/main.ts` is "Initialize git repo" and the logic for it is present at `src/tasks/init-git-repo`

`src/utils` holds utility / helpers function like parsing cli args, checking for correct template name, showing welcome and outro messages etc.

`src/types.ts` holds all the type

# Trying out locally :

Clone and get into working directory :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carletex/create-dapp-example
cd create-dapp-example
```

**Option 1.** Dev & cli

Get Rollup watching for changes:
```bash
yarn dev
```

Edit files as you want. When you want to run the cli tool, just do:
```bash
yarn cli
```

This script automatically deletes the `test/` folder. Therefore, a convenient command to run for iterating without having to manually delete folders would be:
```bash
yarn cli test -s
```
Which generates the output in the `test/` folder and skips installing dependencies. That `test/` folder would then be deleted in the following `yarn cli` run.

**Option 2.** Build & npx

```bash
yarn build && npx .
```

**Option 3.** Linking package locally and running watch mode:

```bash
# Make sure you are in create-dapp-se2 directory
yarn link

# This will watch and compile as you edit files
yarn dev
```

Testing :

```bash
# In new terminal
cd ..
mkdir test-dapp-se2

# Running this will execute the local bin file
create-dapp-se2
```
